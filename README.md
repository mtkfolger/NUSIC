NUSIC - A Website For Discovering New Music From Around The World    

---------

User Story:

As a person interested in learning about music that people are listening to in other countries

I want to be able click on any location in a rendered world map 

AND/OR 

I want to be able to click on any link in the navigation bar

So that I am shown the top music charts for any specified country / artist / genre and be introduced to new music from around the world

---------

Description:

For our first group project, we decided to create a website that allows users to identify popular music in any country across the globe, simply by the click of a mouse. Thus, an interactive map takes up most of the screen so that users can effectively select any one of the 195 countries across the globe. The map also displays each country's name when scrolled over by mouse. However, if users prefer an alternative search option, they may use the nav-bar, which links to music lists sorted by country, genre or artist. Specific direction on how to navigate the website can be found by clicking the 'instructions' tab which in turn opens to a modal box.

Instructions: 

How to search?

Move mouse icon to a specfic country 
Right-click the country to see specific music-chart information

OR

Challenges: 

1. Displaying the necessary information for each country
2. Loading interactive map to fit the page
3.
